If you can't access RubyGems (mainly because IPV6 is blocking, but you do not want to block it) then install it from here, or find another repository. You need to UNTAR this folder so you can install it.
How to UNTAR a tgz file: 
1. Put in terminal: tar -xzvf (filename).tgz (in this case it would be rubygems.tgz)
2. if you're on a desktop environment, you can also extract it using the right click menu on most debian/ubuntu based distros.
